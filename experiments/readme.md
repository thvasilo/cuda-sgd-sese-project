# Notes about the programs here
* batch_size_experiment.py: the actual script that I use to run my experiments.
* cuda_gradient_descent_event.cu : The script where I leartn to use time eval.
* cuda_gradient_descent_norm.cu : The script where time eval is used instead.
* cuda_gradient_descent.cu: the final script that is used in conjuntion with the python script. This is the one that I decided to use. The **good** one.
* python_script.cu just a test script for testing how to use python to run other programs
